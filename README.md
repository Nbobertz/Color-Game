# Color-Game
Directions: The game will display 6 random colors, one of which corresponds to an RGB value displayed at the top of the screen
            It is your goal to try and select the color which properly corresponds to that value
            if you select the wrong square it will slowly dissapear and a message will appear saying "try again"
            There is a reset button on the left of the bar near the top of the screen which reads either "new colors" or "tray again?"
